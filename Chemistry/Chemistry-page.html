        <pre>Questions on the Models of Rutherford, Bohr, Quantum mechanics
            During Rutherford model, it was described that his model had a planetary structure like our solar system as the nucleus was the sun and particles around them as the negative parts or also the electrons gathered around the mass of the nucleus circulating around it much like our planets does.
            The nucleus was positioned as small and dense of scattering alpha particles from thin gold foil as done by experiments form Ernest Marsden under the direction of Rutherford, and Hans Geiger. A radioactive source that is able to emit alpha particles was enclosed in a lead shield and the radiation was focused into a narrow beam after is passed through a slit in a lead screen. A thin piece of gold was placed in front of the slit, and a screen covered with zinc sulfide to detect alpha particles. To Rutherford and his crew to see is any alpha particles were being deflected off the gold foil
            Bohr atomic model
            The Bohr model is considered the predecessor of the quantum mechanics model and the first that incorporated quantum theory. The Bohr model and others describes the properties of atomic electrons of a set of allowed values. Atoms absorb or emit radiation only when the electrons abruptly jump between allowed, or stationary states.
            Before 1913 the atom was always thought of to have a tiny heavily positive charge called a nucleus. But bhor thought otherwise, what he thought of was by limiting the orbiting electrons to a series of circular orbits having discrete radii, he proposed that radiated from hydrogen atoms only when an electron made a transition from an outer orbit to one closer to the nucleus. The energy lost by the electron in the abrupt transition is precisely the same as the energy of the quantum emitted light .
            Quantum mechanics model
            The quantum mechanical model is based on mathematics though it is more difficult to understand than the Bhor Model, the quantum model is based on quantum theory, which says matter also has properties associated with waves, based on everyone it's impossible to know the exact position and momentum of an electron at the same time. It is known as the uncertainty principle.
            The quantum mechanical model uses complex shapes of orbitals, volumes of space in where there is probably going to be an atom. The model is based on probability than certainty.
            Questions of Test
            Which does of the models all have in common 
            They all find electrons in the model and find where they are forming or are orbiting around the nucleus.
            What does all the models differ from one another.
            The Quantum mechanics Model uses mathematics for finding, where electrons are going to form and is based on quantum theory.
            The Bohr model, proves that electrons losing energy have the same amount of energy as the quantum light emitted. 
            The Rutherford model wanted to prove that the nucleus is the main object that makes it look like the solar system and the model wanted to prove that electrons bounce off or pass through gold foil as a shield  
            During ionized elements which element has the highest energy to keep electrons hovering around them 
            Neon 
            Fluorine
            Oxygen 
            Silicon   
            Which of these elements has the lowest energy that releases the elements if it's too small
            Iron
            Sodium
            Helium
            Bromine
            Which elements are metals
            Iron 
            Neon
            Manganese 
            Nickel
            Which is a non metal
            Nitrogen
            Rhanium
            Lithium
            Soduim
